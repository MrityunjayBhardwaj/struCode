# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** A standalone, embeddable Strudel editor that plays audio, exports WAV, and gives real-time visual feedback — clean enough to drop into any React app as a single import.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — pianoroll-visualizers

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (pianoroll-visualizers) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Existing]: Engine layer (StrudelEngine, HapStream, OfflineRenderer, WavEncoder, noteToMidi) fully implemented — do not rewrite
- [Existing]: webaudioRepl chosen over raw Scheduler for better superdough integration
- [Existing]: queryArc() used in OfflineRenderer — AudioWorklet cannot be re-registered in OfflineAudioContext
- [Init]: Core + export first, then layer features — natural build order confirmed as: Highlighting → Pianoroll → Audio Vizs → Monaco → Polish
- [Phase 01-active-highlighting]: Per-hap IEditorDecorationsCollection: each hap gets its own collection for independent clear() calls without affecting other active haps
- [Phase 01-active-highlighting]: Canvas ctx.fillStyle color parsing for per-note color injection — graceful fallback to base class if canvas unavailable in test/SSR environments
- [Phase 01-active-highlighting]: useHighlighting call placed before handlePlay/handleStop so clearHighlights binding is available in callback closures — React const bindings are not hoisted
- [Phase 01-active-highlighting]: setHapStream(engine.getHapStream()) on every play call is safe — HapStream instance is stable per engine lifetime, useState skips re-render on identity equality
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: Unknown sounds fall back to --accent, not --stem-melody — no melody branch in getColor()
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: ResizeObserver created in same useEffect as p5 instance to share cleanup closure
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: Pure math functions exported from PianorollSketch for direct unit testing without p5 mock
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: VizPanel does not contain ResizeObserver — useP5Sketch handles canvas resize internally
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: data-active attribute uses string 'true' not boolean to match DOM attribute conventions in tests
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: viewZones.ts named as imperative module (not useViewZones.ts) — hooks reserve use* prefix
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: addInlineViewZones receives engine.getAnalyser() synchronously to bypass React state timing for view zones
- [Phase 02-pianoroll-visualizers]: viewZoneCleanupRef pattern: store cleanup fn in ref, caller calls before each new addInlineViewZones invocation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Active highlighting requires `scheduledAheadMs` delay — highlights must fire at audioTime, not schedule time (see HapEvent shape)
- Monaco view zones reset on editor re-layout — inline pianoroll must re-add after every evaluate()
- Phase 2 pianoroll inline view zones depend on Phase 1 decorations infrastructure being in place
