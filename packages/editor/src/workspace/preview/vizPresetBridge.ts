/**
 * vizPresetBridge — Phase 10.2 Task 06.
 *
 * Two small functions that bridge between the persisted `VizPresetStore`
 * (IndexedDB, Phase 10.1 artifact) and the in-memory `WorkspaceFile` store
 * (Phase 10.2 editing layer). Per CONTEXT S6: the two stores are NOT
 * continuously synced — they're bridged explicitly at tab-creation time
 * and at save-time, and nothing in between.
 *
 *   - `seedFromPreset(preset)` — read a preset and create a WorkspaceFile
 *     with the preset's code. Called by Task 09's viz editor compat shim
 *     on tab open, and by Task 10's app startup sequence when restoring
 *     the open-tab set.
 *
 *   - `flushToPreset(fileId, presetId)` — read the current file content
 *     from the workspace store and write it back to the preset store via
 *     `VizPresetStore.put`. Called by Task 09 when the user hits Ctrl+S
 *     inside a viz editor tab.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Why a dedicated bridge module
 *
 * Phase 10.1's `VizEditor.tsx` loads presets directly into its own tab
 * state (`VizEditor.tsx:136-148` today). Post-refactor, that coupling
 * dies — the editor doesn't know about `VizPresetStore`, and the
 * provider doesn't know about the file store beyond its `ctx.file`
 * snapshot. Something has to stitch the two sides at the bookends of a
 * file's lifetime. That something is this file.
 *
 * Both functions are pure data utilities — no React, no UI, no bus
 * subscription. Task 09 (the editor compat shim) mounts them into the
 * Ctrl+S keyboard handler. Task 10 (the app rewire) calls them on
 * startup. This file itself never renders anything.
 *
 * ## Language mapping
 *
 * `VizPreset.renderer` is either `'hydra'` or `'p5'`. `WorkspaceLanguage`
 * is either `'hydra'` or `'p5js'` (the extra `js` comes from the Monaco
 * language id that the p5 editor uses for syntax highlighting, which is
 * `p5js` not `p5`). We map at the boundary — callers don't need to know
 * the quirk.
 *
 * ## File id generation
 *
 * `seedFromPreset` returns the workspace file id so callers can track
 * which file belongs to which preset. The id is derived from the preset
 * id with a `viz:` prefix to avoid collisions with pattern file ids
 * (which use their extension as a hint) and with the bundled-preset
 * prefix. This keeps the two-store bridge visible at a glance in
 * debugging output — `viz:__bundled_piano_roll_hydra__` immediately
 * tells you "this workspace file was seeded from the piano-roll bundled
 * preset."
 *
 * Re-seeding the same preset is safe: `createWorkspaceFile` overwrites
 * the existing entry and notifies subscribers, so the editor view
 * picks up the fresh content on the next render.
 *
 * The `presetId` is stashed in `WorkspaceFile.meta.presetId` as a
 * back-reference so tests and future callers can read it without
 * having to re-parse the file id. The `meta` bag is the documented
 * escape hatch for per-file metadata that doesn't belong on the
 * store's public API.

/*
 * Auto-registration of presets into `namedVizRegistry` is owned by the
 * consumer (app layer or compat shim), NOT the bridge. Importing
 * `compilePreset` here pulls the full renderer stack (p5 / hydra-synth)
 * into the bridge's module graph, which breaks any test that mocks or
 * stubs the renderer layer — the module transitively fails to load
 * before the mock takes effect. Keeping the bridge pure data lets
 * unit tests of `flushToPreset` / `seedFromPreset` run without the
 * renderer pack.
 *
 * See `workspace/preview/namedVizBridge.ts` for the consumer-facing
 * helper that combines compilation + registration for convenience.

 *
 * The caller passes a `VizPreset` object directly — the IndexedDB read

 * the seed itself synchronous lets the Task 09 compat shim call it
 * inside a React `useEffect` without an async dance, and lets tests

 * Read the current content of a workspace file and write it back to the

 * entry to overwrite) — these are usually the same up to the `viz:`
 * prefix, but keeping them separate lets a future "save-as" flow write
 * to a different preset id from the file's origin.
 *
 * Returns a promise that resolves once the IndexedDB write completes.
 * On unknown file id the function is a no-op and resolves immediately —
 * the user hitting Ctrl+S on a dead tab should not throw.
 *
 * Updates `updatedAt` to the current time. `createdAt` and `id` are
 * preserved from the existing preset entry to keep persistence stable
 * across saves. If the preset does not yet exist in the store (e.g.,
 * first save of a brand-new file), the preset is created with
 * `createdAt` set to `updatedAt`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Why the caller supplies the preset id
 *
 * `WorkspaceFile.meta.presetId` stores the back-reference (see
 * `seedFromPreset`), but meta is opaque typed (`Record<string,
 * unknown>`) so callers have to read it themselves. Requiring the
 * preset id as an explicit argument removes that bookkeeping from this
