/**
 * playbackCoordinator — single-source-at-a-time playback across tabs.
 *
 * Stave's UX model: only ONE audio source is playing at any given
 * time. Starting a new one (a pattern runtime's `play()`, or a
 * built-in example like drum pattern / chord progression / sample
 * sound) should stop whatever was playing before, without the user
 * having to manually stop the old source.
 *
 * This module is a tiny coordinator that audio sources register
 * themselves with. Each registered source provides an idempotent
 * `stop()` callback. When any source calls `notifyPlaybackStarted`,
 * the coordinator invokes `stop()` on every OTHER registered
 * source, leaving just the started one active.
 *
 * ## Why a separate module (instead of threading through React)
 *
 * Playback sources live in different layers: `LiveCodingRuntime`
 * (class instances), `sampleSound` / `drumPattern` /
 * `chordProgression` (module-level singletons). None of them share
 * a React component tree, and the relationship between them is
 * "at most one active at a time" — a cross-cutting concern that
 * doesn't map cleanly to props or context. A module-level
 * coordinator is the smallest thing that correctly expresses that
 * relationship.
 *
 * ## Stop callbacks must be idempotent
 *
 * The coordinator calls every non-matching registered `stop()` on
 * every start event. If `stop()` was already called (source is
 * already idle), calling it again must be a no-op. All existing
 * sources already satisfy this — `LiveCodingRuntime.stop()`
 * checks `isPlayingState`, `stopSampleSound` checks `state !==
 * null`, etc.
 *
 * ## Stop callbacks must not throw
 *
 * The coordinator wraps each `stop()` in a try/catch so a broken
 * source can't prevent others from stopping. A throw is logged
 * (console) but the iteration continues.
 *
 * ## Not a React hook
 *
 * The coordinator is plain module functions — no React involved.
 * React components that want to observe playback state can call
 * `onPlaybackChanged` to subscribe.
