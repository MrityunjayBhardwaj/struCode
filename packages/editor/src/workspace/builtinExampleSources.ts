/**
 * Registry of built-in example audio sources.
 *
 * Each entry describes a module-level singleton audio source
 * (sample sound, drum pattern, chord progression) that the viz
 * chrome offers in its source dropdown alongside user-published
 * patterns. The registry is data-driven so adding a new example
 * just appends an entry — the dropdown picks it up automatically,
 * and so do every gesture path that needs to start/stop a
 * built-in (chrome click, dropdown change, tab close).
 *
 * ## Why a shared module
 *
 * Both `VizEditorChrome` (Stop click + dropdown change) and
 * `WorkspaceShell.handleTabClose` need to dispatch `stopIfRunning`
 * for the right built-in when the user pushes a "make it quiet"
 * gesture (click Stop, pick "none", × the preview tab). Without
 * a shared registry, each callsite would import three pairs of
 * start/stop functions and re-derive the routing logic. With the
 * registry, both callsites import the SAME data structure and
 * the routing is one-line lookup-by-id.
 *
 * Pattern runtime sources (Strudel/SonicPi tabs) are deliberately
 * NOT in this registry. They have their own pattern tab, their own
 * Play/Stop button, and their own runtime instance per tab — the
 * cross-tab "make it quiet" gestures must not reach into someone
 * else's tab.
