/**
 * PreviewView — Phase 10.2 Task 03.
 *
 * Hosts a `PreviewProvider`'s rendered output for a single workspace file.
 * Owns:
 *
 *   1. Theme application on its DOM root (PV6 / PK6).
 *   2. Bus subscription via `props.sourceRef`, stored as local state.
 *   3. React-key-driven re-mount of the provider output on publisher
 *      identity change (CONTEXT D-01 — subscribe + re-mount).
 *   4. Hot-reload debounce per `provider.reload` / `provider.debounceMs`
 *      (CONTEXT D-07).
 *   5. Hidden-tab pause semantics (CONTEXT D-03) — `keepRunningWhenHidden`
 *      providers keep getting renders; others freeze the debounce and
 *      see `hidden: true` in their context; un-hiding triggers one
 *      catch-up reload so content changes that arrived while hidden are
 *      not lost.
 *   6. Source selector chrome (audio source dropdown).
 *
 * Does NOT own:
 *
 *   - Provider creation or registry lookup (Task 06).
 *   - Popout window bridging (existing `usePopoutPreview` handles that).
 *   - Error boundaries around `provider.render` (Task 06 adds them when
 *     the concrete providers ship and can throw meaningfully).
 *   - Tab-level `sourceRef` state (shell owns it in Task 04; this view is
 *     controlled).
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Why re-mount on publisher identity change (D-01)
 *
 * A viz renderer typically captures the `AnalyserNode` on mount and reads
 * from it per frame. If the publisher changes while the renderer is
 * alive, the renderer is still holding the OLD analyser node reference
 * even after we update state with the new payload. The cleanest way to
 * force a fresh `analyser` capture is to unmount-and-remount the
 * renderer. We do this with a React `key` that includes the current
 * publisher's source id (or `'none'` when null). When the id changes,
 * React tears down the subtree and mounts a fresh one — the provider's
 * `render` is called again with the new `audioSource`, and any effects
 * inside its returned tree capture the new analyser on their own mount.
 *
 * The pre-mortem in PLAN.md §10.2-03 flags this as the most likely
 * secondary failure. The test case `switching sources re-mounts the
 * provider output` guards against regressions.
 *
 * ## Reload policy dispatch (D-07)
 *
 * Three modes:
 *   - `'instant'` — every file content change increments the reload
 *     counter synchronously. No timers.
 *   - `'debounced'` — a timer is (re)started on every content change.
 *     When it fires, the reload counter increments. Rapid typing
 *     collapses into a single reload after `debounceMs` of quiescence.
 *   - `'manual'` — file content changes do nothing. The provider is on
 *     its own to re-render (e.g., by keeping internal state).
 *
 * The reload counter is used as part of the React `key` on the provider
 * output, so every increment forces a full unmount/remount. This matches
 * the publisher-identity re-mount pattern — one mechanism, two triggers.
 *
 * ## Hidden-tab pause (D-03)
 *
 * `provider.keepRunningWhenHidden === false` means "do not burn frames
 * on an invisible canvas." When `props.hidden === true` AND the provider
 * opted out of background running, we:
 *
 *   1. Pass `hidden: true` to the provider's `render` context — the
 *      provider's returned component can check this and pause its RAF
 *      loop.
 *   2. Skip the reload counter bump on content change (the debounce
 *      timer is still cleared on every change, it just never fires
 *      a visible reload).
 *   3. On un-hide, trigger ONE reload to pick up any content changes
 *      that arrived during the hidden period. The `catchUpNeededRef`
 *      tracks whether any content changes were missed.
 *
 * Providers with `keepRunningWhenHidden === true` never see `hidden:
 * true` — the host always passes `false` for them, so the provider's
 * behavior is unchanged regardless of `props.hidden`.
 *
 * ## Demo mode (P7)
 *
 * When `sourceRef.kind === 'none'` OR the bus has no matching publisher,
 * `audioSource` is `null`. PreviewView deliberately DOES NOT render a
 * "no data" placeholder — the provider is responsible for demo-mode
 * fallback content (per CONTEXT P7). PreviewView DOES show a small badge
 * in the chrome area so the user understands why the canvas looks
 * different.
 *
 * ## Source selector chrome
 *
 * Reads `workspaceAudioBus.listSources()` on EVERY open of the selector
 * (not cached in state) per CONTEXT pre-mortem #6 — stale cached
 * entries would desync from actual publishers as they start/stop. A
 * simple `<select>` element serves as the minimal chrome for Task 03;
 * Task 04 / Task 05 may dress it up further.

 *
 * @remarks
 * The payload object itself does not carry its source id — by design,
 * per the CONTEXT D-02 comment that the sourceId is "implicit from the
 * subscribe key." We derive the id from the ref:
 *
 *   - `{ kind: 'none' }` → `'none'` (no publisher).
 *   - `{ kind: 'file', fileId }` → `fileId` if payload is non-null.
 *   - `{ kind: 'default' }` → `bus.listSources()[last].sourceId` at the
 *     moment the payload arrived. We cannot read this from the payload;
 *     we look it up via the bus state. Because the default tracker
 *     always points at the most-recent publisher, and `listSources()`
 *     returns the recency list, the last entry IS the id we want.
 *     If the list is empty, the payload must be null and we return
 *     `'none'`.
