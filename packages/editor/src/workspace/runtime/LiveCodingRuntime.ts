/**
 * LiveCodingRuntime — Phase 10.2 Task 05.
 *
 * Per-file runtime that wraps a `LiveCodingEngine` with the workspace audio
 * bus publish/unpublish lifecycle. One runtime per workspace file id; the
 * runtime owns the engine, owns any elevated `BufferedScheduler`, and is
 * responsible for keeping the bus's view of "this file is playing" in sync
 * with the engine's actual state.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Why this lives in `workspace/runtime/` and not `engine/`
 *
 * The engine layer (`packages/editor/src/engine/`) defines the
 * `LiveCodingEngine` interface and ships concrete engines (`StrudelEngine`,
 * `SonicPiEngine`, `DemoEngine`). It knows nothing about the workspace,
 * the audio bus, or react. The runtime is the bridge: it lives in the
 * workspace layer because it depends on `workspaceAudioBus`, `WorkspaceFile`
 * snapshot identity, and the workspace concept of a "file id" — but it
 * never reaches into engine internals. The boundary is one-way: workspace
 * imports from engine, never the other way.
 *
 * ## What this file MUST NOT do (PV1, PV2, P1, P2)
 *
 * - It MUST NOT touch `Pattern.prototype`. All Strudel Pattern method
 *   wrappers are installed inside `StrudelEngine.evaluate()`'s `.p` setter
 *   trap. Re-installing them here would either no-op (if installed before
 *   `injectPatternMethods`, which the engine calls during `evaluate`) or
 *   silently break the engine's own wrappers (if installed after, which
 *   would race the engine's restoration in its `finally` block).
 *
 *   This restriction is enforced by a source-grep test in
 *   `__tests__/strudelRuntime.test.tsx` — the assertion fails if any of
 *   `Pattern.prototype` shows up in any runtime/ source file.
 *
 * - It MUST NOT mutate `file.content` before passing to `engine.evaluate`.
 *   Strudel's transpiler reifies string arguments (P1) — the EXACT string
 *   the engine sees is load-bearing. Any "preview validation" or
 *   "sanitization" in this layer breaks `.viz()` reification, mini-notation
 *   parsing, and `setcps()` extraction in unpredictable ways.
 *
 * - It MUST NOT install its own `.viz()` interceptor. The engine already
 *   captures viz requests in `engine.components.inlineViz.vizRequests` after
 *   `evaluate()` resolves; the runtime forwards the captured map through
 *   the bus payload's `inlineViz` slot. Task 07's EditorView reads from
 *   there to materialize Monaco view zones.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle (PK1)
 *
 * The `play()` method is the only nontrivial sequence in this file. The
 * nine-step lifecycle is documented in `LiveCodingRuntime` interface
 * JSDoc in `types.ts`. The two ordering constraints worth restating here:
 *
 *   - **`evaluate` MUST resolve before `engine.components` is read.** The
 *     engine populates `inlineViz.vizRequests` and `queryable.scheduler`
 *     during `evaluate`. Reading `components` mid-`evaluate` returns a
 *     half-baked bag.
 *   - **`bus.publish` MUST happen before `engine.play`.** Subscribers (viz
 *     consumers, the EditorView's inline-zone effect) need the payload in
 *     hand BEFORE the first hap event fires. If we published after
 *     `engine.play()`, the first cycle of audio events would land in a
 *     subscriber that hasn't been wired to a HapStream yet.
 *
 * Between step 4 (`evaluate` resolves) and step 7 (`bus.publish`), there
 * must be no `await`. A microtask boundary at that point would let another
 * `play()` invocation interleave its own evaluate and corrupt the
 * components view we're about to publish. Steps 5 and 6 are pure object
 * construction and synchronous BufferedScheduler instantiation; both are
 * safe.
 *
 * ## BufferedScheduler elevation (S8)
 *
 * Sonic Pi (and any future engine that ships streaming + audio without a
 * native queryable) does not provide a `PatternScheduler` in
 * `engine.components.queryable`. The runtime detects this on every play
 * and lazily constructs a `BufferedScheduler` wrapping the engine's
 * `HapStream` and `AudioContext`. The elevated scheduler is held on
 * `bufferedSchedulerRef` so `dispose()` can release it. On engines that
 * DO ship a native queryable, the elevated ref stays `null` and the
 * native scheduler is forwarded directly through the payload.
 *
 * ## Error semantics (S7)
 *
 * Two error sources flow through the runtime:
 *
 *   1. **Evaluate errors** — `engine.evaluate(code)` returns
 *      `{ error: Error }`. The runtime fires `onError` listeners and
 *      returns the error from `play()`. The bus is NOT touched (no
 *      publish, no unpublish-on-error).
 *   2. **Runtime audio errors** — the engine's
 *      `setRuntimeErrorHandler(cb)` fires AFTER `play()` succeeded, when
 *      a scheduled event hits a sound-not-found or similar runtime
 *      condition. The runtime forwards these to its own `onError`
 *      listeners as well. Audio keeps playing — these are not fatal,
 *      just visible diagnostics.
 *
 * The chrome subscribes to `onError` for the toolbar error badge; Task 07's
 * EditorView subscribes for Monaco squiggle markers via `setEvalError`.
 * Both consume the same event source, no two-way coupling.

 * `setcps` line is present or the expression is unparseable.
 *
 * Strudel's `setcps` takes cycles-per-second; the conventional Strudel
 * preset uses `setcps(120/240)` to mean "120 BPM at 4 beats per cycle"
 * (240 = 60 seconds × 4). The conversion BPM = cps × 60 / beatsPerCycle
 * collapses to BPM = (numerator / denominator) × 60 for the standard
 * 4-beat cycle, which is what the legacy `StrudelEditor.tsx:111-115`
 * extraction does. The runtime mirrors that exact logic so the BPM
 * display in the new chrome matches the old one byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Lives at module scope (not as a method) so the function is pure +
 * trivially testable + has zero `this`-binding gotchas.

/**
 * Constructor argument shape. Kept as a positional triple rather than an
 * options object because the contract is small and stable: a runtime is
 * defined entirely by its file id, the engine it wraps, and the function
 * that returns the file's current content at evaluate time.
 *
 * @param fileId - The workspace file id this runtime publishes under.
 *   Used both as the bus key and as the address for `dispose()` cleanup.
 * @param engine - The engine instance this runtime wraps. The runtime
 *   takes ownership; the caller MUST NOT dispose this engine independently.
 * @param getFileContent - Closure that returns the current file content
 *   at the moment `play()` is called. Passing a closure (rather than a
 *   string) lets the runtime stay decoupled from `useWorkspaceFile` /
 *   the workspace store — tests can pass a static string, the live
 *   compat shim can pass `() => getFile(fileId)?.content ?? ''`. This
 *   keeps the runtime testable in a plain Node environment.
