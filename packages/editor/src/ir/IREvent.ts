/**
 * IREvent — the universal music event.
 *
 * Every engine compiles to this. Every consumer (viz, synth, highlighting) reads from this.
 * The IR event is a flat value object — no methods, no prototype, no engine references.
 *
 * Time domain: matches the producing PatternScheduler's now().
 *   - Strudel: cycle positions (0.0, 0.25, 1.0...)
 *   - BufferedScheduler: audioContext seconds (134.5, 135.0...)
 *   - Future engines: whatever their scheduler uses
 * Consumers always compare event.begin against scheduler.now() — same time domain.
