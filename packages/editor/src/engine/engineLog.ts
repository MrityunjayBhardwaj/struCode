 * Goal: one stream of structured log entries that multiple UI surfaces
 * subscribe to — toast on new errors, status-bar LED counting new
 * entries since last opened, Monaco inline markers on the offending
 * file, and a dedicated Console panel with history + filters. Each
 * runtime (Strudel, Sonic Pi, p5.js, Hydra) emits through the same
 * `emitLog` entry point so downstream consumers don't need per-runtime
 * special-casing.
 *
 * The store keeps a bounded history (MAX_HISTORY most recent entries).
 * Listeners are fired synchronously on emit so UI surfaces can update
 * in the same microtask as the runtime error handler.
