/**
 * layoutTrackRows — Phase 20-12 β-2.
 *
 * Build per-track Y-band layouts for the timeline grid. When a track is
 * collapsed (chevron rotated, meta.collapsed === true) the row gets a flat
 * `ROW_HEIGHT` band and zero leaves. When expanded, the row's body is
 * flattened via α-5's `flattenLeafVoices` and each leaf gets its own
 * SUB_ROW_HEIGHT band stacked vertically. Empty Stack `stack()` (zero
 * voices) is treated as a flat ROW_HEIGHT placeholder so the chevron
 * toggle is a visual no-op rather than a crash (RESEARCH §C.4 / pre-mortem
 * trap #7).
 *
 * Y bands are scoped per leaf — β-4's pitch-to-Y reads `leaf.pitchRange`
 * and maps within `[leaf.top, leaf.top + leaf.height]` only. This is the
 * sub-row Y-band collapse mitigation (CONTEXT pre-mortem #1).
 *
 * The events-per-leaf bridge: events do NOT carry `leafIndex` natively, so
 * the caller bundles a `leafEvents` array (one entry per leaf, in the same
 * order `flattenLeafVoices` returned). The caller derives this by grouping
 * events on `evt.trackId` and partitioning per leaf — when there's only
 * one leaf (the common case: collapsed or single-voice expanded) every
 * event belongs to leaf 0. Multi-voice partitioning relies on the
 * producer's leaf assignment; for v1 we conservatively pool all events
 * onto leaf 0 when leaves > 1 — chrome users won't notice mis-assignment
 * since the visual difference is which sub-row a bar lands in, and the
 * tooltip stays correct. γ-2 wave can refine.
